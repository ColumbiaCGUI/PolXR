# antARctica: AR visualizer for ice-penetrating radar data on Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf

This application is being developed to facilitate the analysis of radar data for polar geophysicists by placing the data in context with the ice shelves over which it was collected. A thesis will be made public by October 2022 that gives a more robust explination of the underlying earth science and development process of this project. See the previous iteration of this project + a demo video at https://github.com/sofiasanchez985/greenland
